                        One of the five boroughs of New York City, Manhattan is actually an island, bordered by the East River and the 
                        Hudson (and a little bit by the Harlem River). This island is a bit less than 23 square miles and is home to almost 
                        two million residents. Add in the daily influx of workers, and the island routinely holds close to four million people.

                        and dining, along with incredible museums.
                        Manhattan also has a giant green heart. There's also a lot of green space where you can play and relax, 
                        along with miles of running and skating trails.

                        in 1889 for 41 years until 1930.

                        Use your visit as a stair workout and climb the 300 steps from ground level to the first of three levels on the 
                        tower. Climb another 300 steps to the second level. Then hop on the elevator here to get 
                        to the top. Aside from the workout, you'll also skip most of the crowd who want to take the elevator the whole way.</p>

                        of Muir Woods National Monument are only 30 minutes away and also well worth a side trip.

                        British Colonial history as well. Gleaming skyscrapers are built with hand-assembled bamboo scaffolding in a fusion 
                        of new and old.

                        The city is divided into two main sections: Hong Kong Island and Kowloon.
