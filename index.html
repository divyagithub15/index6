                <h3>France</h3>
                <p>Christmas in Paris isn’t about loud parties or large celebrations. Christmas markets 
                    can be found all over major cities, and France has some of the biggest markets in all 
                    of Europe, but besides that, Christmas is a bit quieter in France.On Christmas Eve, a 
                    yule log is carried into homes across France and soaked in red wine to make the log smell 
                    good as it burns throughout the night. Candles and fires are kept light and food is left 
                    out in the hopes that Mary and the Baby Jesus may stop by. A glass of wine is left out 
                    for Père Noël (Father Christmas) who leaves presents under the tree and small gifts inside 
                    the shoes of good children.</p>

                <p>
                    Caroling is an important tradition, but in Australia, caroling isn’t just neighbors going 
                    door-to-door it’s a cultural event. Carols by Candlelight started in Melbourne in 1938, and 
                    since then has grown into a tradition across the country. On Christmas Eve people gather 
                    outdoors to sing Carols by candlelight. The larger events that take place in major cities 
                    like Sydney are broadcast on TV across the country.
                    
                    On Christmas day loved ones and families gather to eat a feast at around noon. Most people 
                    have a cold meal or barbecue seafood like lobsters and prawns.Australians hang wreaths on their 
                    front doors and sometimes go out Christmas carol singing on Christmas Eve. People also decorate 
                    their houses and gardens with Christmas Trees and Christmas lights. Neighbors sometimes have little 
                    competitions to see who has got the best light display.

                <p>Many Americans, especially Christians will go to Church to celebrate the birth of Jesus at Christmas. 
                    Many churches have special Christmas Carol services and events where the story of Christmas is told.

                    In New England (the American States of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire 
                    and Maine), there are shops called 'Christmas Shops' that only sell Christmas decorations and toys all the year round!
                    
                    Americans also send out Christmas Cards, like Carol singing and there's the unusual custom of the Christmas Pickle!
                    
                    People in America like to decorate the outsides of their houses with lights and sometimes even statues of 
                    Santa Claus, Snowmen and Reindeer. Some cookies and glass of milk are often left out as a snack for Santa 
                    on Christmas Eve!</p>

                    <p>The first day of the Pongal Festival in Tamilnadu is known as Bhogi Pandigai or Bhogi Pongal. It marks 
                        the last day of the Tamil month Marghazi during which people assemble and lights bonfire made of wood 
                        and cow dung to burn the unused household items.People clean their houses, paint and embellish them with

                    <h3>Second Day: Surya Pongal </h3>
                    <p>The second day is known as the Surya Pongal or Thai Pongal which is considered as the main festivity of 
                        the Pongal Festival. It is the first day of the Tamil calendar month Thai and coincides with Makara Sankranti 
                        which is widely celebrated all over India.
                        On Thai Pongal, people decorate their houses with banana or mango leaves and embellish the entrance with colourful 
                        Kolams. The special sweet dish called ‘Pongal’ is prepared in a traditional earthen pot using freshly harvested 
                        rice grains, milk and jaggery which is allowed to boil and overflow out of the vessel, symbolizing their wish of 
                        greater fortunes in the year ahead. The pot is typically decorated by tying a turmeric plant or flower garland and

                    <p> The third day- Mattu Pongal is celebrated the day after Surya Pongal. Mattu refers to "cow, bullock, cattle",

                        and agricultural aid. On Mattu Pongal, cattle are decorated – sometimes with flower garlands or painted horns, 
                        they are offered bananas, a special meal and worshipped. Some decorate their cows with manjalthanni 
                        (turmeric water) and oil. Shikakai apply kungumam (kumkum) to their foreheads, paint their horns, and feed them 
                        a mixture of venn pongal, jaggery, honey, banana and other fruits. Others bathe their cattle and prostrate 
                        before them with words of thanks for the help with the harvest.

                        festivities for the year. The word kanum (kaanum) in this context means "to visit." Many families hold 
                        reunions on this day. Communities organize social events to strengthen mutual bonds. Villagers cut and 
                        consume farm fresh sugarcane during social gatherings. Relatives, friends and neighbors visit to greet, 
                        while youngsters go out to meet seniors among the relatives and neighborhoods to pay respects and seek blessings, 
                        while some elders give the visiting children some pocket change as a gift.</p>

                    <p>Jallikattu (or sallikkattu), also known as eru thazhuvuthal and mañcuvirattu, is a disputed traditional event 
                        in which a bull (Bos indicus), such as the Pulikulam or Kangayam breeds, is released into a crowd of 
                        people, and multiple human participants attempt to grab the large hump on the bull's back with both arms and 
                        hang on to it while the bull attempts to escape. Participants hold the hump for as long as possible, attempting
                         to bring the bull to a stop. In some cases, participants must ride long enough to remove flags on the bull's 
                         horns.

                        Jallikattu is typically practised in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu as a part of Pongal celebrations on Mattu 
                        Pongal day, which occurs annually in January.</p> 
                        
                         <p>‘Jallikattu‘ and ‘Katha Kalakshepam’ in temples are the prime attraction of the Pongal Festival in Thanjavur. 
                         The Department of Tourism Government of Tamilnadu organizes Pongal Tourist Festival in Thanjavur which is worth 
                         attending. The Festival includes village visits, traditional games, Pongal demonstrations, bullock cart ride and
                          folk dances. </p>
