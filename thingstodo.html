           </p>
            <p id="para"> 
                The cost of airfare is one of the main reasons people don’t travel more. However, thanks to the rise of international 
                budget airlines and deal finding websites, it’s gotten a lot easier to fly around the world on the cheap!

                5. Get accommodation
           </p>
            <p id="para">

                for you, find the best deals, avoid being scammed, and break out of the hotel/hostel mold.

            <p id="para"> 
                Long-term travel is one of the most exciting, interesting, and learning experiences a person can do in their lifetime. 
                It makes you a far more well-adjusted person, more open-minded, more independent, and more confident.
